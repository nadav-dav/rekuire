Rekuire [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/rekuire.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/rekuire)
=========
'rekuire' is basically node's 'require' without the relative paths!

It saves you TONS of time refactoring your code, and making it easily reusable.
plus, it makes you code more *readable* = **better!**

Installation
-------------
to install, type
> ```npm install rekuire```

or add it to your ```package.json``` as a dependency.

How to use it?
-----------------
instead of doing this: <br/>
> ```var MyModule = require('../../../MyModule.js');``` *<-- yuck!*

why not do this:<br/>
```
var rek = require('rekuire');
var myModule = rek('MyModule');
```
<br/><br/>

or that:<br/>
```
var myCoffee = rek('MyCoffee.coffee');
var myJson = rek('myJson.json');
var myModule = rek('src/api/MyModule');
```
<br/>

<br/>


in order to tell the scanner, not to scan specific folders<br/>
use: <br/>
```
var mypath = rek.ignore('out', 'target', 'static/js');
// you should only do it once in your code
```

<br/>


if you want to resolve only the file location, for example, when you want to use [proxyquire][proxyquire].<br/>
use: <br/>
```
var mypath = rek.path('MyModule');
// mypath = 'lib/classes/MyModule.js' 
```

<br/>

for more examples, I recommend you to checkout the spec file :)

what does it do?
----------------
when 'rekuire' is first loaded to the project, it scans the source files locations,
so when you need them they are right there to use!
no relative paths are needed! *yeahy!*

how to handle nested project dependencies?
----------------

When you've got a project and a dependency that both use `rekuire`.  Like so:

    # npm list
    # parent application
    # +-- rekuire@0.1.4
    # ¦ +-- underscore@1.5.2
    # +-- nested project
    #   +-- rekuire@0.1.4
    #     +-- underscore@1.5.2

You need to specify additional search directories in the dependency.  Somewhere in the dependency, (the `index.js` file maybe) add the following line:

    var rek = require('rekuire');
    rek.addSearchDirectory( __dirname );
